                According to MMA portal Tapology.com listings, hundreds of MMA promotions around the world produce MMA events.
                
                Since the UFC came to prominence in mainstream media in 2006, and with their 2007 merger with Pride FC and purchases of WEC and Strikeforce, no companies have presented significant competition, and the UFC is regarded as having most of the top ranked talent. Fighters usually get contracts in the UFC after competing successfully in other MMA promotions from around the world.
                
                Some MMA promotions tend to exist more to build up prospects while others have a mix of prospects and veterans. Some exist only to be feeder leagues to the bigger promotions (e.g. LFA, CWFC), others exist to try to be the best in the world (e.g. ACB, ONE Championship). Some promotions only do four shows a year while others are doing them monthly.
                
                <br>According to ScorecardMMA.com, one of the world's top statistical rankings services for MMA, and the only one currently ranking MMA promotions worldwide statistically; "To rank MMA Promotions we use an index that we calculate weekly- Promotion Score.Promo Score calculation is based on the strength of Events and Fighters that Promotion has at that time. Promo Score has three main components:
                
                <br>Event Index: based on the quality of events in the last quarter and in the last year.
                Owned Fighter Index: calculated based on the quality of fighters that the promotion currently owns (contracted, or used recently).
                Utilized Fighters Index: fighters that the promotion has used in the last four months and in the last three quarters.
